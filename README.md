**HQ Trivia Practice!**

This is a tool to help you get better at HQ. You can use this to learn to google better or increase your guess percentage
by seeing savage questions and pointing out the obvious answers.

The questions are pulled from http://hqbuff.com/, so not all questions are available.
You can pull the questions yourself with the python tool I have written here: https://github.com/nwk6661/HQBuffScraper 

I am bad at GUIs so feel free help.
