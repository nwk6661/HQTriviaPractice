**HQ Trivia Practice!**

This is a tool to help you get better at HQ. You can use this to learn to google better or increase your guess percentage
by seeing savage questions and pointing out the non-obvious answers.

The questions are pulled from http://hqbuff.com/ (Thanks for the API <3), so not all questions are available.
The program features a button that allows you to automatically generate the most recent set of questions,
 so you can always be up to date. 

I am bad at GUIs so feel free help.
